        How COVID-19 upended bankruptcy trends
      </h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Historically, bankruptcy filings and unemployment rates have moved in lockstep. The pandemic changed that.

      <div class="block">
        The pandemic was supposed to bring a devastating wave of bankruptcies. Instead, they’ve continued a decade-long decline. The number of personal and business bankruptcies filed in 2020 dropped 30% from the year prior, while 2021 saw an even more dramatic decline at 47%.

      <div class="block">
        The counterintuitive trend has confounded researchers, though <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3690398">researchers</a> attribute it to the impact of large-scale economic stimulus packages, including the $2 trillion CARES Act and the Main Street Lending Program, and widespread availability of unemployment insurance.

        The researchers also highlight the diverging role bankruptcy plays for corporations versus smaller businesses and consumers. At the onset of the pandemic, business chapter 7 bankruptcies — which are largely exercised by small- or medium- firms and focus on liquidation — dropped 22%, while chapter 11s — which are filed mostly by larger companies and focus on restructuring — continued an earlier upward trend.

        “While large corporations may be able to efficiently turn to bankruptcy as a source of protection, small firms and consumers often only view it as a last resort and are more likely to avoid filing in the absence of a precipitating event,” the authors write. “Thus far, the COVID-19 crisis has coincided with a wave of large corporate filings largely driven by sectors such as retail that were already struggling prior to the pandemic.”

        By contrast, small businesses and consumers alike were hit harder by economic uncertainty and other court barriers, likely stalling filing progress.

        As government assistance dries up, some economists portend a wave of filings, as bankruptcies are often long-tail indicators of financial distress.

        “Bankruptcies don’t cause damage to the economy,” Ed Flynn, a consultant with the American Bankruptcy Institute, told the Washington Post. “The damage has already been occurred when the bankruptcy is filed. Higher bankruptcies is more a symptom of economic harm than the cause.”
