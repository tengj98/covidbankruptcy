        How COVID-19 upended bankruptcy trends
      </h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Historically, bankruptcy filings and unemployment rates have moved in lockstep. The pandemic changed that.

      <div class="block">
        The pandemic was supposed to bring a devastating wave of bankruptcies. Instead, they’ve continued a decade-long decline. 
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        In April through June of 2020, unemployment skyrocketed to record highs not seen since 1948, when the <a href="https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000?years_option=all_years">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> began collecting data. Millions of jobs evaporated as companies folded or closed to stop the spread of the coronavirus. 
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        Meanwhile, the number of personal and business bankruptcies filed in 2020 dropped 30% from the year prior. Overall annual filings were a third of that in 2010, following the Great Recession.

        <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3690398">Researchers</a> attribute the counterintuitive trend to the unprecedented impact of federal aid. Large-scale economic packages like the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and the Federal Reserve's Main Street Lending Program offered relief for consumers and companies alike, in the form of stimulus checks, unemployment benefits, and business loans.

      <div class="block">
        The pandemic also highlighted the diverging role bankruptcy plays for corporations vs. small firms. At its onset, business chapter 7s, which are often filed by small- and medium-sized businesses, dropped 34% year-over-year in the second quarter. Chapter 11s, which are mostly exercised by more established companies, continued an upward march, swelling by 36% when compared to the same period.

        The growth in chapter 11s shows how larger companies are able to effectively turn to bankruptcy as a refuge in times of financial distress. Smaller businesses, by contrast, see bankruptcy as a last resort. A volatile economy and court barriers likely further hindered filing progress — resulting in the drop in chapter 7s.

        <blockquote>"Large businesses have continued to seek and receive relief from the bankruptcy system as they would during a normal recession, and relatively wealthy homeowners have on average benefited from the fiscal stimulus and housing moratoria mandated by the CARES Act and other policies," the researchers write. "However, non-homeowners and small businesses may face financial, physical, and technological barriers to accessing the bankruptcy system, especially in the areas hardest-hit by unemployment."</blockquote>

        As government assistance dries up, some economists portend a wave of filings, as bankruptcies are often long-tail indicators of financial distress.

      <div class="block">
        “Bankruptcies don’t cause damage to the economy,” Ed Flynn, a consultant with the American Bankruptcy Institute, told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/26/pandemic-economy-bankruptcies/">the Washington Post</a>. “The damage has already been occurred when the bankruptcy is filed. Higher bankruptcies is more a symptom of economic harm than the cause.”
